The increasing availability of student data has highlighted the potential of leveraging machine learning (ML) to enhance educational outcomes. This report details the development of an ML-based platform aimed at improving student performance through personalized recommendations, targeted practice sessions, and enhanced teacher-student interactions. The platform will analyze students' grades, academic subjects, and other relevant details to provide tailored suggestions for improvement. It will offer daily 15-minute practice sessions to address specific problem areas and include a feature for direct communication between students and teachers. The design incorporates both thermal and mechanical considerations to ensure robust and efficient operation. The platform will be built using a comprehensive tech stack, including a backend system for data processing and ML model deployment, a frontend interface for user interaction, and a database for storing user information and performance metrics. The final design will be validated through extensive testing, including performance, usability, and safety evaluations. Key aspects of the project include a detailed exploration of system-level and subsystem-level designs, benchmarking against existing solutions, and adherence to relevant standards and constraints. The report covers the concept generation and selection processes, including feasibility analysis, and the development of a final design, with a focus on manufacturability, cost, and validation.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0649e5f-53ed-4917-ab32-45193927f74c)
